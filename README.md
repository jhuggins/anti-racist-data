# Anti-racist Datasets

This is a repository of datasets for teaching statistics and machine learning
methods that reflect contemporary issues of anti-racism and inclusion.
The goal is to provide resources help educators inform students about
the value of statistics and data when trying to address and understand problems
of racism and unequal treatment of marginalized groups.

If you are interested in contributing, details on how to do so are below.
